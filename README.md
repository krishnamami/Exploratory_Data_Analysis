# Exploratory Data Analysis

As part of this exercise, I set out to explore a comprehensive range of EDA techniques to better understand the dataset and uncover meaningful patterns. The goal was to move beyond surface-level summaries and dig deeper into the dataâ€™s structure, variability, and predictive potential.

I focused on leveraging powerful Python data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to:

--> Analyze feature distributions and relationships

-->Visualize class-wise trends and feature separability

-->Identify potential predictors and class imbalances

--> Gain deeper intuition around feature importance and data structure

This hands-on approach not only reinforced EDA best practices but also strengthened my familiarity with modern visualization tools in the Python ecosystem.

ðŸ‘‰ This was conducted as an internal learning and enablement exercise for my team, with the objective of exploring the often-overlooked capabilities of EDA. The insights and methods developed here are now being applied to enhance our daily operations, complementing traditional reporting tools such as Grid reports and opening up new avenues for data-driven decision-making.
