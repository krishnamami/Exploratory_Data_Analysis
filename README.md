# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Summary
This project presents a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset**, using statistical summaries and visualizations to derive insights on survival rates and key influencing features. The goal is to uncover patterns that could guide predictive modeling and support medical decision-making.

## Business Context

EDA is a foundational step in any data science and deep dive exploratory analysis. This analysis focuses onexploring the often-overlooked capabilities of EDA.

Insights from this analysis help undeerstand concepts on :
- Feature Importance:Which features correlate most with survival.
- Data Imbalance:Potential imbalances in data that may affect model training.
- Data Visualizations to detect trends:Early signals for feature engineering or risk stratification models.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Visualization Libraries**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy

## Key Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics and distribution plots
- Boxplots, violin plots, and pairplots for feature comparison
- Class-wise analysis for survival status
- Heatmaps for correlation visualization
- Feature separation analysis to identify model-ready variables

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnamami/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.git
   cd Exploratory_Data_Analysis
   python eda.py
