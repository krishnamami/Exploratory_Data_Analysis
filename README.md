# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Summary
This project presents a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset**, using statistical summaries and visualizations to derive insights on survival rates and key influencing features. The goal is to uncover patterns that could guide predictive modeling and support medical decision-making.

## Business Context

EDA is a foundational step in any data science and deep dive exploratory analysis. This analysis focuses onexploring the often-overlooked capabilities of EDA.

Insights from this analysis help undeerstand concepts on :
- Feature Importance:Which features correlate most with survival.
- Data Imbalance:Potential imbalances in data that may affect model training.
- Data Visualizations to detect trends:Early signals for feature engineering or risk stratification models.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Visualization Libraries**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy

## Key Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics and distribution plots
- Boxplots, violin plots, and pairplots for feature comparison
- Class-wise analysis for survival status
- Heatmaps for correlation visualization
- Feature separation analysis to identify model-ready variables

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnamami/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.git
   cd Exploratory_Data_Analysis

As part of this exercise, I set out to explore a comprehensive range of EDA techniques to better understand the dataset and uncover meaningful patterns. The goal was to move beyond surface-level summaries and dig deeper into the dataâ€™s structure, variability, and predictive potential.

I focused on leveraging powerful Python data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to:

--> Analyze feature distributions and relationships

-->Visualize class-wise trends and feature separability

-->Identify potential predictors and class imbalances

--> Gain deeper intuition around feature importance and data structure

This hands-on approach not only reinforced EDA best practices but also strengthened my familiarity with modern visualization tools in the Python ecosystem.

ðŸ‘‰ This was conducted as an internal learning and enablement exercise for my team, with the objective of exploring the often-overlooked capabilities of EDA. The insights and methods developed here are now being applied to enhance our daily operations, complementing traditional reporting tools such as Grid reports and opening up new avenues for data-driven decision-making.
